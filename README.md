### Project Summary
This project is a simple list-detail application developed using the MVVM architecture and Clean Architecture approach with the Kotlin programming language. Model classes were created for each module and these classes were connected to each other through mapper classes. The Android Navigation library was used in the project. Additionally, Mockito library was used for test writing, and Kotlin Coroutines were used for asynchronous operations. Custom views were used for some special views, and the Room library was integrated for certain sections. Base classes were created for the presentation layer, and unit tests were written for the view model. The JSON assets used in the application were taken from.
